### What is this random project?

This project was created during the Coronavirus pandemic to better connect friends together. 

### What do I need to run this?

Just Java :)

### Your code is weird and not at all optimized

I'm an AP CS student at my high school, so what I would say is don't expect top notch code. I am trying my best. If you have any suggestions I am very open to them. I want to use this project as a learning experience, so any feedback on how I could improve my code would be very helpful.
