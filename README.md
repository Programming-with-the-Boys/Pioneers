# Pioneers of Natagg

### What is this random project?

This project was created during the Coronavirus pandemic to better connect friends together. 



### What do I need to run this?

Just Java :)



### Your code is weird and not at all optimized

I'm a first year CS student at my high school. I am trying my best. If you have any suggestions I am very open to them. I want to use this project as a learning experience, so any feedback on how I could improve my code would be very helpful.
